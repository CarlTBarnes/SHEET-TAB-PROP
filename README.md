## SHEET-TAB-PROP - Sheet Tab Property and Attribute Explorer

 The SHEET and TAB control has many Attributes and Properties that allow configuring dozens of ways. The IDE Window Designer has all the attributes but does not always render the control correctly. The only way to see the Sheet accurately is to preview the window.

 This tool allows you to configure all the Sheet attributes and see a Preview Sheet change live. It also allows configuring several properties ( PROP: ) which is not possible with Designer.

 In the middle of the preview Sheet the Window code shows e.g. below ```SHEET,AT(,,,),LEFT, UP,DOWN,JOIN ```

It also shows any properties set e.g. the Tab Ear style was set below toi Offer 2003 Black & White with: ```?Sheet{PROP:TabSheetStyle}=TabStyle:BlackAndWhite ! Style=1```

At the bottom I work out the position of the Tab rectange and the client rectange which is used to resize a text control with the Sheet Code.

On the “View Sheet Poperties” tab the Tool also allows viewing all the runtime PROP:’s you can access:
